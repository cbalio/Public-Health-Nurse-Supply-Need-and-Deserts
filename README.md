**Study Purpose**

The purpose of this study is to describe the need for and supply of public health nurses (PHN) in local, governmental public health, as well as identify PHN deserts where there is high need and low supply. Additional details regarding study design, approach, and results can be found in the manuscript: [PLACEHOLDER]

**PHN Need Index**

In order to estimate county-level need for PHNs, an index was developed using 16 measures across 4 domains. We developed a national index on a 1-100 percentile scale (1 indicates lowest need across the country relative to other counties, 100 indicates highest need) and a state-level version for use within states using deciles (1 indicates lowest need within the state, 10 indicates highest need within the state). Domains are listed below. Additional details on the methodology of the index development, data sources, measures and domains are forthcoming. 

Domain 1: Demographic Indicators

Domain 2: Economic Indicators

Domain 3: Healthcare Context

Domain 4: Health Status and Outcomes

**Identifying PHN Priority Counties**

County-level PHN prioritizaiton was defined as counties with relatively high need and low supply of PHNs. Data is limited to counties with PHN staffing data from the 2019 NACCHO Profiles. Counties with complete data are categorized into three priority tiers with priority tier 1 being the highest priority and priority tier 3 being the lowest priority tier. Details on defining and identifying PHN deserts are forthcoming. 

**Data**

Data for the national and state versions of the PHN Need Index and the priority indicators are available in the Excel file. Data for national and state versions of the PHN Need Index are available for 2,823 counties. Data for PHN priority tiers is available for 783 counties.
