**Study Purpose**

The purpose of this study is to describe the need for and supply of public health nurses (PHN) in local, governmental public health, as well as identify PHN deserts where there is high need and low supply. 

**PHN Need Index**

In order to estimate county-level need for PHNs, an index was developed using 16 measures across 4 domains. We developed a national index on a 1-100 percentile scale (1 indicates lowest need across the country relative to other counties, 100 indicates highest need) and a state-level version for use within states using deciles (1 indicates lowest need within the state, 10 indicates highest need within the state). Domains are listed below. Additional details on the methodology of the index development, data sources, measures and domains are forthcoming. 

Domain 1: Demographic Indicators

Domain 2: Economic Indicators

Domain 3: Healthcare Context

Domain 4: Health Status and Outcomes

Data for the PHNN Index is available in the file titled: _County-Level State and National PHNN Index Data_

**Identifying PHN Deserts**

PHN deserts were defined as counties with relatively high need and low supply of PHNs. Data is limited to counties with PHN staffing data from the 2019 NACCHO Profiles. Counties with complete data are categorized into four priority tiers with priority tier 1 being the highest priority and priority tier 4 being the lowest priority tier. Details on defining and identifying PHN deserts are forthcoming.
